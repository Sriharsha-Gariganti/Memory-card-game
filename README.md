##Memory Card Game

## Project Overview
The **Memory Card Game** is a classic game designed to test and improve memory skills. Players flip cards to find matching pairs while keeping track of their moves and time. This project demonstrates the use of modern web development technologies and practices.

## Features
- **Dynamic Grid Sizes**: Players can choose between Easy (4x4), Medium (6x6), and Hard (8x8) levels.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Timer and Move Counter**: Tracks time elapsed and moves made.
- **Score Calculation**: Scores decrease with more moves and elapsed time, rewarding efficiency.
- **Flip Animations**: Smooth transitions when cards are flipped.
- **Matched Card Effects**: Visual feedback for matched pairs.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the game.
- **CSS**: Styling, animations, and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, interactivity, and dynamic rendering.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone or download the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/memory-card-game.git
   ```

2. Open the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd memory-card-game
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

Alternatively, you can host the project using a static server or deploy it using platforms like GitHub Pages.

## How to Play
1. Choose a difficulty level: Easy, Medium, or Hard.
2. Flip two cards by clicking on them:
   - If the cards match, they remain flipped.
   - If they donâ€™t match, they flip back after a short delay.
3. Keep flipping cards until all pairs are matched.
4. Your score is calculated based on the number of moves and time taken.
